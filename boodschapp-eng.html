			<h2> Problem statement </h2>
			<p> Even before going to the supermarket, as a parent you know without a doubt, that taking your child with you to do the grocery is a very bad idea. Children don’t like it and usually make this known by throwing a tantrum or other unruly behavior. This in turn ruins the experience for the parent. They have to divide their attention between their children and the grocery and as a result they forget to buy an item or two. It also takes a lot longer than usual to do the shopping when taking your child with you. </p>
			<h2> Goal statement </h2>
			<p>The goal here is to make an app for a supermarket, we chose to do it for Albert Heijn, that helps improve the experience of the parent and their child. This app is supposed to motivate the children to help with the grocery, make sure the parents don’t forget any items and also help them keep an eye out for their child.  </p>
			<h2> User needs </h2>
			<p> After doing some research, including interviews with the target group, were the following user needs and wishes obtained:</p>
			<ul> 
				<li> The children should be able to walk alone in the supermarkt and put the right product in the cart. </li>
				<li> Parents need to be able to keep an eye out on their children. </li>
				<li> Grocery shopping should become more fun. </li>
				<li> No item of the grocery list must be forgotten.  </li>
				<li> Grocery shopping must not take too much time. </li>
				<li> The application can be used on both a phone and an iPad. </li>
			</ul>

			<h2> Product </h2>
			<p> With the userneeds and the information gotten out of the interviews and research was the BoodschApp made. But the App is not the only thing that was made for this project. There is for the children also a program made to use inside the supermarket. This program can be found on the tablet that is provided by the supermarket. It helps the children find their way to the desired product, scan it and helps them signal their parent to let them know where they are, this prevents them from getting lost. The recieve points for every product, which then gets put on their profile. This is where the app comes in. </p>
			<p> The app contains different profiles. There is a profile for the parents and for the children. The parents use their profile to make a grocery list, scan the products and keep an eye out on their children. The children use their profile to win even more points by playing different games and cooking different recipes. </p>
